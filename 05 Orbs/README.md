# Orbs

**Description:**

We have a config file that requires a specific Ruby version be installed, however the image we are using doesn't have Ruby, so the build fails. Utilizing the Ruby Orb (`circleci/ruby`) install Ruby version `2.6.3` so the build will be green.

**Goals:**

- Add the Ruby Orb to the config file
- Install Ruby version `2.6.3` with Orb
- Build should be green if Ruby installed properly

**Help:**
