# Matrix Builds

**Description:**

We want to run our job across multiple versions of Node and on both Mac and Linux. Utilize Matrix builds to accomplish this without adding a job for each setup.

**Goals:**

- Add a matrix condition to run the jobs for both `linux` and `macos`
- Add a matrix condition to run the jobs for the following node versions: `12.9.1`,`13.9.0`,`14.18.2`,`16.13.1`
- Share link to green build that executed all 8 jobs, should look like this:
