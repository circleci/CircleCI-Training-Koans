# Conditional Logic

**Description:**

This config makes use of "Conditional Logic" to have certain actions only occur when certain conditions are met.

**Goals:**

- Add a condition that when your branch equals `main` the job echoes "I am on main"
- Add a condition that when the pipeline parameter `condition-workflow` is equal to `true` the "conditional-workflow" runs
- Share link to green job that executed both the "conditional-workflow" and echoed "I am on main".
