# Workspaces

**Description:**

In this challenge, 3 applications will be created in a workflow. One for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. Each build job will generate an app file that needs to be persisted to the final `deploy` job, which will then upload these apps as artifacts.

**Goals:**

- Persist each of the apps in the build jobs to the final deploy job.
- Upload all of the apps to your artifacts.
- Provide a link to your final workflow.

**Help:**
